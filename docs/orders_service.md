# Order Service

## Overview

The Order Simulation Service is designed to generate simulated order data by processing input from three main data tables: Customers, Addresses, and Products. The service utilizes AWS Kinesis to implement a producer-consumer structure that streams the simulated order events. These streams can then be consumed by various downstream applications for analysis, monitoring, and further processing.
